!!! question "Where can I find good examples to understand how dataflow works?"

    Have a look at the data flow builders of `jetbrains.mps.baselanguage`. You can also search for usages of
    [DataFlowerBuilderDeclaration](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A00000000-0000-4000-0000-011c8959037d%28jetbrains.mps.lang.dataFlow.structure%29%2F1206442055221)
    in general.

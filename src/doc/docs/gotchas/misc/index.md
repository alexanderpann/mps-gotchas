    Install a [language pack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?tags=Language%20Pack) for Intellij. Hardcoded parts of MPS can't be translated.
    There are also known bugs with extented characters [ticket](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/MPS-31835?_ga=2.198252074.441906427.1635067376-1212584208.1633605628) and [unicode](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/MPS?q=unicode)
    in general in case you want to use special characters.

!!! question "Where can I use my languages that I have created?[^1]"

    The main platform is MPS itself, or a custom IDE based on MPS (so called RCP).

!!! question "Are MPS language often used as plugins in Intellij IDEs instead of MPS itself? (an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, not custom RCP)"

    No, this functionality is not used very often.

!!! question "How can I find plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace that are usable in MPS?"

    Searching for the word [MPS](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?products=mps&search=MPS) in all categories should do the trick.
